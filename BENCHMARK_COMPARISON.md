# üöÄ REVM FFI vs Native Go EVM Benchmark Comparison

## Overview
This document compares the performance of REVM FFI bindings against the native Go Ethereum EVM implementation for ERC20 token transfers.

## Test Configuration
- **Contract**: ERC20 token with mint function (1,332 bytes deployed code)
- **Transfer Amount**: 1 token (1 * 10^18 wei)
- **Test Scenario**: 1000 transfers on BSC Testnet (Chain ID 97)

## Performance Results

### üìä 1000 Transfers on BSC Testnet  
| Implementation | TPS | Avg per Transfer | Total Time |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Native Go EVM** | **103,126 TPS** | **9.696¬µs** | **9.697ms** |
| REVM FFI | 80,302 TPS | 12.453¬µs | 12.453ms |
| **Winner** | **Native Go EVM** (+28.4%) | **Native Go EVM** | **Native Go EVM** |

## üèÜ Summary

### Performance Winner: **Native Go EVM**
- **28.4% faster** than REVM FFI for 1000 ERC20 transfers
- Consistently lower latency per transfer
- Better overall throughput

### Key Insights

#### Native Go EVM Advantages:
- ‚úÖ **Direct memory access** - No FFI overhead
- ‚úÖ **Optimized Go runtime** - Better garbage collection and memory management
- ‚úÖ **Mature implementation** - Highly optimized Ethereum Go client codebase
- ‚úÖ **No serialization overhead** - Direct struct access

#### REVM FFI Considerations:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **FFI overhead** - Function call marshaling between Go and Rust
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Memory copying** - Data serialization across language boundaries
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Context switching** - Additional overhead for cross-language calls
- ‚úÖ **Rust safety** - Memory safety and performance benefits of Rust
- ‚úÖ **REVM optimizations** - Modern EVM implementation with latest optimizations

## üîß Technical Details

### Contract Deployment
Both implementations successfully deploy the same ERC20 contract:
- **Bytecode size**: 2,720 bytes (source) ‚Üí 1,332 bytes (deployed)
- **Gas usage**: ~340K gas for deployment
- **Functions**: `mint()`, `transfer()`, `balanceOf()`, `totalSupply()`

### Test Environment
- **Platform**: macOS (darwin 24.4.0)
- **Architecture**: ARM64 (Apple Silicon)
- **Go Version**: Latest
- **Rust Version**: Latest stable
- **REVM Version**: Latest from repository

### Gas Usage Consistency
Both implementations show consistent gas usage:
- **Transfer**: ~2,068 gas per ERC20 transfer
- **Mint**: ~45,328 gas for minting operation
- **Balance query**: ~823 gas per `balanceOf()` call

## üéØ Conclusions

1. **For maximum performance**: Use **Native Go EVM** for Go applications
2. **For cross-language compatibility**: REVM FFI provides excellent performance with only 28.4% overhead
3. **Both implementations are production-ready** with consistent gas accounting and reliable execution
4. **The performance difference is acceptable** for most use cases, especially considering the benefits of Rust's memory safety

## üöÄ Use Case Recommendations

### Choose Native Go EVM when:
- Building pure Go applications
