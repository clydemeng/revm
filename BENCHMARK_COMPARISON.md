## 🏆 Summary

### Performance Winner: **Native Go EVM**
- **7.6% - 13.3% faster** than REVM FFI across all test scenarios
- Consistently lower latency per transfer
- Better overall throughput

### Key Insights

#### Native Go EVM Advantages:
- ✅ **Direct memory access** - No FFI overhead
- ✅ **Optimized Go runtime** - Better garbage collection and memory management
- ✅ **Mature implementation** - Highly optimized Ethereum Go client codebase
- ✅ **No serialization overhead** - Direct struct access

#### REVM FFI Considerations:
- ⚠️ **FFI overhead** - Function call marshaling between Go and Rust
- ⚠️ **Memory copying** - Data serialization across language boundaries
- ⚠️ **Context switching** - Additional overhead for cross-language calls
- ✅ **Rust safety** - Memory safety and performance benefits of Rust
- ✅ **REVM optimizations** - Modern EVM implementation with latest optimizations

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Contract Deployment
Both implementations successfully deploy the same ERC20 contract:
- **Bytecode size**: 2,720 bytes (source) → 1,332 bytes (deployed)
- **Gas usage**: ~340K gas for deployment
- **Functions**: `mint()`, `transfer()`, `balanceOf()`, `totalSupply()`

### Test Environment
- **Platform**: macOS (darwin 24.4.0)
- **Architecture**: ARM64 (Apple Silicon)
- **Go Version**: Latest
- **Rust Version**: Latest stable
- **REVM Version**: Latest from repository

### Gas Usage Consistency
Both implementations show consistent gas usage:
- **Transfer**: ~2,068 gas per ERC20 transfer
- **Mint**: ~45,328 gas for minting operation
- **Balance query**: ~823 gas per `balanceOf()` call

## 🎯 Conclusions

1. **For maximum performance**: Use **Native Go EVM** for Go applications
2. **For cross-language compatibility**: REVM FFI provides excellent performance with only 7-13% overhead
